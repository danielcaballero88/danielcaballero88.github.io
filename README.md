# Daniel Caballero Personal Website

This is just my personal website, which I implemented using Angular mainly to avoid code repetition.
Otherwise the website is simple enough that I could have written it in plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
Also I could have used another simpler framework than Angular, but Angular is the one that I really know my way around so it was the fastest option for me (and, being so simple a website, the end result is good no matter what framework I'd choose).
